# HOTEL BOOKING REPORT USING POWER BI

## üìä Project Overview
This project is a data visualization dashboard built using **Power BI** to analyze hotel booking performance. The dashboard provides insights into key hotel KPIs such as **Total Revenue**, **Occupancy Rate**, **ADR (Average Daily Rate)**, and **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)** across multiple hotel branches. 

The goal is to help hotel management teams identify booking patterns, optimize pricing strategies, and improve overall operational performance.

## üéØ Key Objectives
- Monitor business performance across hotel branches
- Track essential KPIs like ADR, RevPAR, and Occupancy Rate
- Identify revenue trends, booking channels, and guest behaviors
- Reduce cancellations and improve room utilization
- Provide actionable insights through dynamic visuals and drillthroughs

## üîß DAX Measures Used
```DAX
Total Revenue = SUM(Hotel_Booking_Data[Total_Amount])

ADR = DIVIDE(SUM(Hotel_Booking_Data[Total_Amount]), COUNTROWS(FILTER(Hotel_Booking_Data, Hotel_Booking_Data[Status] = "Confirmed")))

RevPAR = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], SUM(Hotel_Booking_Data[Rooms_Available]))

Occupancy Rate = DIVIDE(COUNTROWS(FILTER(Hotel_Booking_Data, Hotel_Booking_Data[Status] = "Confirmed")), SUM(Hotel_Booking_Data[Rooms_Available]))

Max Stay Duration = MAX(Hotel_Booking_Data[Staying_Column])
